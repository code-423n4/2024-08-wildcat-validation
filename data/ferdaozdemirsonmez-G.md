## Title: Transaction Reversion Risk When Processing Multiple Markets in a Loop

## Summary:
When processing a large number of markets in a loop (e.g., 1000 markets), if one market fails (e.g., the 801st market), the entire transaction reverts, wasting gas for the 800 successfully processed markets. This can lead to significant gas inefficiencies.

## Impact:
If a transaction processes multiple markets and one market fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and all gas consumed for the successful markets is wasted. This issue can occur when external calls (e.g., call()) are used in a loop, causing the transaction to revert on any failure.
## Proof of Concept:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-wildcat/blob/fe746cc0fbedc4447a981a50e6ba4c95f98b9fe1/src/HooksFactory.sol#L577

In the pushProtocolFeeBipsUpdates function, if one of the external calls to market.setProtocolFeeBips() fails, the whole transaction reverts:
for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    address market = markets[marketStartIndex + i];
    assembly {
        if iszero(call(gas(), market, 0, setProtocolFeeBipsCalldataPointer, 0x24, 0, 0)) {
            mstore(0, 0x4484a4a9) // SetProtocolFeeBipsFailed()
            revert(0x1c, 0x04)
        }
    }
}
If the 801st market fails, the transaction reverts, and the gas used for the first 800 markets is wasted.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
To avoid the risk of reverting the entire transaction, split the process into smaller independent steps, where each group of markets is processed separately. This way, a failure in one group doesn't affect others, and gas for successful operations is preserved.
Recommended Steps:
1.	Process Markets in Groups: Rather than handling all markets in one go, process smaller groups of markets independently. This prevents a failure from wasting gas used in successful executions.
2.	Graceful Error Handling: Instead of reverting on failure, log errors and skip problematic markets to allow the process to continue without interruption.
By adopting these strategies, the system can improve gas efficiency and reduce the risk of wasted gas in large-scale operations.
