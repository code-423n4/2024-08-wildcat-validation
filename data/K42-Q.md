### Low Severity Issues:

### L-01 Unconstrained `timeToLive` parameter in `addRoleProvider`

#### Proof of Concept

In AccessControlHooks.sol and FixedTermLoanHooks.sol:

```solidity
function addRoleProvider(address providerAddress, uint32 timeToLive) external onlyBorrower {
  RoleProvider provider = _roleProviders[providerAddress];
  if (provider.isNull()) {
    bool isPullProvider = IRoleProvider(providerAddress).isPullProvider();
    provider = encodeRoleProvider(
      timeToLive,
      providerAddress,
      isPullProvider ? uint24(_pullProviders.length) : NotPullProviderIndex
    );
    // same 
  }
}
```

#### Impact

Extremely long or short `timeToLive` values could disrupt role management and access control.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add bounds checking for `timeToLive`.

### L-02 Immediate role provider removal without safeguards

#### Proof of Concept

In AccessControlHooks.sol and FixedTermLoanHooks.sol:

```solidity
function removeRoleProvider(address providerAddress) external onlyBorrower {
  RoleProvider provider = _roleProviders[providerAddress];
  if (provider.isNull()) revert ProviderNotFound();
  _roleProviders[providerAddress] = EmptyRoleProvider;
  // same
}
```

#### Impact

Accidental or malicious instant removals could cause abrupt service disruptions.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use time-delayed, two-step removal process.

### L-03 Unlimited token approvals in `transferFrom`

#### Proof of Concept

In WildcatMarketToken.sol:

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external virtual nonReentrant returns (bool) {
  uint256 allowed = allowance[from][msg.sender];
  if (allowed != type(uint256).max) {
    uint256 newAllowance = allowed - amount;
    _approve(from, msg.sender, newAllowance);
  }
  // same
}
```

#### Impact

Unlimited approvals increase user risk exposure if approved contracts are compromised.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Create an approval reduction function and set max approval limits.

### L-04 Missing slippage protection in `executeWithdrawal`

#### Proof of Concept

In WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol, the `executeWithdrawal` function lacks slippage protection:

```solidity
function executeWithdrawal(
  address accountAddress,
  uint32 expiry
) public nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
  MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();
  uint256 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = _executeWithdrawal(
    state,
    accountAddress,
    expiry,
    _runtimeConstant(0x44)
  );
  _writeState(state);
  return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;
}
```

#### Impact

Users get less value than expected when market conditions change between queuing and executing a withdrawal. 

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add slippage protection by including a `minAmountOut` parameter.

### L-05 Front-running vector in `setMaxTotalSupply`

#### Proof of Concept

In WildcatMarketConfig.sol, the `setMaxTotalSupply` function allows the borrower to change the maximum total supply without any time delay:

```solidity
function setMaxTotalSupply(
  uint256 _maxTotalSupply
) external onlyBorrower nonReentrant sphereXGuardExternal {
  MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();
  if (state.isClosed) revert_CapacityChangeOnClosedMarket();

  hooks.onSetMaxTotalSupply(_maxTotalSupply, state);
  state.maxTotalSupply = _maxTotalSupply.toUint128();
  _writeState(state);
  emit_MaxTotalSupplyUpdated(_maxTotalSupply);
}
```

#### Impact

This immediate change in max total supply could be exploited by front-running. A malicious borrower could manipulate the market capacity right before large deposits or withdrawals, even trapping user funds or allowing unfair advantages.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a time delay mechanism for changing the max total supply.

### L-06 Unprotected withdrawal queuing against price fluctuations

#### Proof of Concept

In WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol, the `queueWithdrawal` function does not include slippage protection:

```solidity
function queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant returns (uint32 expiry) {
  // same
}
```

#### Impact

Users could receive less than expected if the market conditions change between queueing and execution of the withdrawal.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use slippage protection.

### L-07 Temporary fund locking in `queueWithdrawal`

#### Proof of Concept

In WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol, the `queueWithdrawal` function queues withdrawals without a cancellation mechanism:

```solidity
function queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant returns (uint32 expiry) {
  MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();
  uint104 scaledAmount = state.scaleAmount(amount).toUint104();
  if (scaledAmount == 0) revert NullBurnAmount();
  Account memory account = _getAccount(msg.sender);
  return _queueWithdrawal(state, account, msg.sender, scaledAmount, amount, _runtimeConstant(0x24));
}
```

Once a withdrawal is queued, users cannot cancel or modify it until the withdrawal batch is processed.

#### Impact

Users might face situations where their funds are temporarily locked in a queued withdrawal, possibly missing other opportunities or facing unexpected financial constraints.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Put a cancellation mechanism for queued withdrawals.

### L-08 DOS risk in `getRegisteredBorrowers`

#### Proof of Concept

In WildcatArchController.sol, the `getRegisteredBorrowers` function returns all registered borrowers without pagination:

```solidity
function getRegisteredBorrowers() external view returns (address[] memory) {
  return _borrowers.values();
}
```

#### Impact

As the number of registered borrowers grows, this function could hit the gas limit, making it unusable and possibly causing issues for dependent systems.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add pagination for large data sets:

```solidity
function getRegisteredBorrowers(uint256 offset, uint256 limit) external view returns (address[] memory, uint256) {
  uint256 total = _borrowers.length();
  uint256 end = MathUtils.min(offset + limit, total);
  uint256 count = end - offset;
  
  address[] memory borrowers = new address[](count);
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    borrowers[i] = _borrowers.at(offset + i);
  }
  
  return (borrowers, total);
}
```

This approach allows callers to retrieve borrowers in manageable chunks, preventing out-of-gas errors and improving overall system reliability.
