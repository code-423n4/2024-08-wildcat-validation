If a market uses another market as its underlying asset, borrower of the parent market can prevent protocol fee collection, by eg calling `blockFromDeposits(feeRecipient)`

```solidity
  function onTransfer(
    address /* caller */,
    address /* from */,
    address to,
    uint /* scaledAmount */,
    MarketState calldata /* state */,
    bytes calldata extraData
  ) external override {
    HookedMarket memory market = _hookedMarkets[msg.sender];

    if (!market.isHooked) revert NotHookedMarket();

    // If the recipient is a known lender, skip access control checks.
    if (!isKnownLenderOnMarket[to][msg.sender]) {
      LenderStatus memory toStatus = _lenderStatus[to];
      // Respect `isBlockedFromDeposits` only if the recipient is not a known lender
      if (toStatus.isBlockedFromDeposits) revert NotApprovedLender();
```
