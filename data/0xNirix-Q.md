1. Inefficient Credential Validation: Potential Double-Check of Same Provider in AccessControlHooks Contract

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-wildcat/blob/fe746cc0fbedc4447a981a50e6ba4c95f98b9fe1/src/access/AccessControlHooks.sol#L670-L680

```solidity

// Handle the calldata suffix, if any
if (_handleHooksData(status, accountAddress, hooksData)) {
  return (true, true);
}

uint256 pullProviderIndexToSkip = type(uint256).max;

// If lender has an expired credential from a pull provider, attempt to refresh it
if (!lastProvider.isNull() && status.canRefresh) {
  if (_tryGetCredential(status, lastProvider, accountAddress)) {
    return (true, true);
  }
  // If refresh fails, provider should be skipped in the query loop
  pullProviderIndexToSkip = lastProvider.pullProviderIndex();
}
```

If the hooksData has a length of 20 bytes (which represents just a provider address), _handleHooksData will attempt to get a credential from that provider using _tryGetCredential.
If that fails, the code then checks if there's a lastProvider and attempts to refresh the credential using the same _tryGetCredential method.
If the provider in hooksData (with length 20) is the same as lastProvider, this would result in trying to get a credential from the same provider twice.

This redundancy could lead to unnecessary gas consumption and potentially confusing behavior.
